<!-- <p>A Cloud Kitchen is a restaurant specifically set up to take advantage of the popularity of on demand services. Supplying their customers indirectly through online ordering apps and websites. Typically the premises are located within the delivery range of a large city, but outside the most expensive high traffic areas. This greatly reduces cost and can provide a more efficient space for creating great food. </p>

<br>
<h2>Benefits of delivery only</h2>
<br>

<p>A Cloud Kitchen should be seen as an opportunity to create a highly specialised and focused production of fresh takeaway meals. The only goal is to create food, the additional management of the front of house tasks are gone, along with staff, customers, and cleaning.</p>

<p>The kitchen is the new production line, and you can have a larger kitchen to accommodate more demand. Your chefs are in a nicer kitchen and great working environment. Order appears in their lane, and they directly pass the product to the delivery driver. The delivery is the only focus of the chef and the output can be much faster than a dual use kitchen providing in house meals as a priority.</p>

<p>Beyond the concept of a fusion or hybrid restaurant, generally one cuisine is specialised and the front of house themed to suit that style. The front of house for a Cloud Kitchen is its online presence, this opens the possibility to provide multiple different brands on each of the online ordering apps.  For example, your company - “Killer Kitchens” has both “Killer Kitchens - Indian” and “Killer Kitchens - Chinese” as options on the app. Allowing you to cover a larger portion of the delivery market in that given area.</p>

<p>Flexibility, you have much more room to make changes to your menu, branding and processes. As all of your customer visible branding will be online it's as simple as updating, copy, and images. You may have spent thousands to re-theme your storefront before with little results, now you can iterate and even adapt based on feedback. Maybe even following the concept of A/B testing and really fine tuning what your customers react to best.</p>

<br>
<h2>Variations of Cloud Kitchens</h2>
<br>

<p>The term Cloud Kitchen may well be fairly new but the concept has been around for a long time. Pizza delivery is a very common use of the Cloud Kitchen model, Dominos have the concept perfected now and are at a scale where they can cut out the middle men online ordering services with their own apps and websites.</p>

<br>
<h4>Independant</h4>

<p>A single brand using one kitchen to provide orders around a single cuisine. They provide delivery only and do not have a front of house. The method of delivery is irrelevant, they can either use self delivery or an aggregator.</p>

<h4>Multi-Brand</h4>

<p>Multiple cuisines or brands served from a single kitchen. This is the concept described earlier under “Killer Kitchens”.  They are not limited to a single cuisine so can cover a much larger demographic of customers.</p>

<h4>Delivery App Owned</h4>

<p>Think Deliveroo, they provide the interface to your kitchen and then pick up the product and deliver it for you. The restaurant is a single cuisine style and the customer can also pick up if desired. </p>

<h4>Fully Outsourced</h4>

<p>Can be thought of as an overflow kitchen, the Cloud Kitchen buys materials and prepares a majority of the meal, it then supplies it to restaurants for finishing touches. It can then even pick up the finished result and deliver it to customers.</p>

<h4>Satellite</h4>

<p>A single Cloud Kitchen supplying multiple small satellite storefronts. This can be a great way to support high throughput in smaller premises. Think out of town kitchen preparing all the food to be finished at a pop up stall or on site van. </p>

<br>
<h2>Current market</h2>
<br>

<p>The overall hospitality market is huge, and the Cloud Kitchen sector is expected to grow to 2.63 billion more in the next six years. There is a stark difference in the way services and media are consumed when compared to ten years prior. The culture now in many countries is to prefer on demand, why go into a shop when you can have a product delivered the very next day, or push around a busy supermarket when it can all be delivered to your door. Similarly the food industry is already most of the way there in terms of the popularity of delivery services. The market has boomed and given restaurants hundreds of online services of which they can take advantage of.</p>

<p>This huge selection of services provide a never ending supply of would be customers, creating a great menu and an exceptional service will set you well on the way to success. Companies such as Delivaroo and Uber have spotted this opening in the market and are already staking their claims. Deleivaroo created a specialised branch of delivery only kitchens called Editions. Taking advantage of the data that they pull from the usage of their apps they can pinpoint cuizines missing in a given city and supply that niche.</p>

<p>Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has launched CloudKitchens with a $5 Billion evaluation. Which is a franchise on the delivery only model. They provide the equipment services and tools to get going quickly. A big play in the delivery only market and one sure to do well.</p>

<h2>Future of Cloud Kitchens</h2>
<br>

<p>The customers have led the way in creating a new business, their demands change how the industry works, the big players have caught on and staked their claims. The tide is still rising on this new opportunity and the lockdowns and enforcements across the world in response to Covid-19 will help reinforce the culture of ordering online.</p>

<p>UBS predicts that delivery could be cheaper than home prepared meals in the near future. Following suit to the traditional home created clothes, almost a century ago before it was less economical to buy mass prepared clothing.</p>

<p>The pressures of maintaining a storefront in a post Covid world may prove a thankless task in the future, and the allure of a Cloud Kitchen will strike many as salvation. The costs may be cheaper and some of the management will be lessened but making a great kitchen still requires all the same hard work and ingenuity as before, the best all rounders will reap the most rewards.</p> -->
